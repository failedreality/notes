Notes for InfoSec and THM, HTB, etc

GOAL:
To start collecting notes that I take while learning about information security.
In the hope to retain more knowledge via note taking then just reading and doing labs.

Thanks to: Golgothus for the idea on this.

Especially since we are teaming up on these projects.
